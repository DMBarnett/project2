Lightly grease four 6-ounce ramekins with nonstick cooking spray. Set a small saucepan over high heat and add the granulated sugar to make caramel. Without stirring let the sugar melt. As it melts gently swirl the pan around to melt all the sugar evenly. When it turns dark amber carefully divide evenly among the ramekins (take care as the caramel is extremely hot). Combine the milk and superfine sugar in a saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer. Add the egg yolks whole eggs and vanilla to a large mixing bowl. Whisk together until foamy then add a little of the hot milk to temper the eggs. Stir to combine then gradually add the rest of the milk (adding it all at once or too much will cook and scramble the eggs). Once completely incorporated stir well and then divide evenly among the four ramekins. Line a turkey roaster with a kitchen towel and carefully place the ramekins on top. Place the roasting dish in the oven then fill with hot water so it comes 3/4 of the way up the sides of the ramekins. Bake until the custards are set 35 minutes.

19;"Homemade Brioche (Oh glorious buttery Brioche)";"Start with the sponge. You can heat up the milk in a saucepan or just pop it in the microwave for about 20 seconds. Put the milk yeast egg and 1 cup of flour in your stand mixer's bowl. Mix the ingredients with a spatula until all is blended. Sprinkle over the other cup of flour to cover the sponge and let it rest uncovered for 30 minutes.After 30 minutes there should be cracks in the flour. The cracks let you know that the yeast is working its magic!Good we are done with the sponge. Now what's the deal with the sponge? It adds a deep flavor and a lovely texture to the bread and is considered the equivalent of adding another rise to the bread. Now we will turn it into a dough.Add the sugar salt eggs and 1 cup (5 oz) of your flour to the sponge. Put the bowl in your stand mixer and using the dough hook mix on low for 1 minute until the dough starts to come together. With the mixer still running on low add in the remaining 2.5 oz of flour (1/2 cup). When the flour has been incorporated bump the speed up to medium and mix for 15 minutes. After 10 minutes have passed the dough should be slapping itself against the side of the bowl. If it's not add 3 tbsp more of flour. Make sure you don't skimp on kneading the dough for 15 minutes.Bash out the butter with a bench scraper on a piece of wax paper or plastic wrap so it's soft and pliable (but not melted or greasy) and turn your mixer down to medium low. Add the butter a couple tbsp at a time waiting until each installment of butter is absorbed before adding the next. And don't be worried if your butter has a hard time incorporating into the dough. It will be fine. When all the butter has been added bump the speed up to medium high for a minute then reduce to medium and knead the dough for 5 minutes. The dough should be slapping the bowl again by the end. The dough will be soft and sticky and may cling a little bit to the sides of the bowl.Butter a large bowl (I did a 5 qt bowl) and transfer the dough to that bowl covering the top tightly with plastic wrap. Let it rise at room temperature for 2 hours until it has doubled in size.Since yeast tends to clump up we want to redistribute the yeast. However we don't want to deflate the dough too much. So very gently with a spatula turn the dough upside down and around to redistribute the yeast a little bit. It's fine if it deflates a little bit just don't purposely bash it down. Cover again with plastic wrap and let it rise in the refrigerator for 7 hours (you could do as short as 4 hours if it rises enough but longer rising means more flavor so it's always best to be patient with bread. Believe me I am an impatient lady so I know it's hard lol).With a sharp knife gently slice your dough into 3 sections. Cut each section into 6 pieces. You may gently roll those pieces into balls but I chose to leave them sort of square. Place 6 balls in each loaf pan and cover with plastic wrap. Let it rise for 2 hours.When you are ready to bake preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and bake for about 30 minutes until the interior is 200 degrees F on an instant read thermometer. If during the baking process your brioche browns too much loosely cover the loaves with tin foil. Cool on a baking rack and enjoy! And make sure you taste some of it when it comes out of the oven...so goooooood!";558875;"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/558875-556x370.jpg,";"2018-11-27 16:10:18";"2018-11-27 16:10:18"
