519983,Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter Oatmeal Skillet Cookie,Preheat oven to 350F spray oven-safe skillet with cooking spray (mine is a Le Creuset enameled cast iron and I sprayed liberally with Pam for Baking and it released like a charm; if skillet is well-seasoned cast iron you may wish to butter or grease it slightly; set skillet aside. Alternatively cookie may be baked in a 9-by-9 inch square baking pan that has been lined with foil or sprayed with cooking spray; do not use a 9-inch circular pie dish because it will be too shallow. In a large microwave-safe bowl melt the butter about 1 minute on high power (you may microwave butter to a browned-butter state which makes this cookie especially delicious by cooking butter for about 3 to 4 minutes; watch it closely so it doesn't burn. See browning butter in the microwave tips. To the melted butter add sugar egg vanilla and whisk or stir vigorously to combine for about 1 minute slightly fluffing up the batter. Add the flour baking soda salt and stir until just incorporated. Add the oats and stir to combine. Pour slightly less than three-quarters of the dough into the skillet reserving about 1 1/4 cups (just eyeball it) to be crumbled on at the end; set skillet and large mixing bowl with reserved dough aside. In a small bowl combine sweetened condensed milk and peanut butter and stir until smooth. Pour mixture over the dough in the skillet. Evenly sprinkle the chocolate chips over the top. Drop tablespoon-sized chunks of the reserved dough into the skillet dispersing then as uniformly as possible over the surface which forms the crumble topping. Bake for about 25 minutes or until edges begin to barely crisp up and most of the top surface of the cookie has set. The center may not be completely set; this is okay because cookie will continue to cook in the skillet after it's been pulled from the oven noting that there is a fairly significant carryover cooking effect with cast iron; so don't overbake in the oven because cookie is meant to be very gooey. Cookie may be served immediately; optionally serve it with ice cream. Cookie is best eaten fresh from the oven but due to its size extra cookie may be sliced and stored in an airtight container at room temperature or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days reheating gently in the microwave before serving leftovers if desired.,https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/519983-556x370.jpg,baking soda-0.5-teaspoon:creamy peanut butter-0.5-cup:egg-1-:flour-0.75-cup:ice cream-1-serving:light brown sugar-0.75-cup:old fashioned rolled oats-1.5-cups:salt-0.5-teaspoon:semi sweet chocolate chips-1-cup:sweetened condensed milk-14-ounce:unsalted butter-0.5-cup:vanilla extract-2-teaspoons:

5132,Cayenne Lime Salmon and Lemon Sponge Cake,Preheat grill to medium high.Rinse salmon dry and place on plate.Rub each fillet with olive oil.Squeeze the juice from one half-lime onto each filet. (You may use less if your filets are substantially smaller.)Sprinkle filets with sea salt and cayenne. Place lime pieces on top of each filet.Grill thicker salmon for about 10 minutes flipping once. (Per this site "Salmon fillets and steaks need 4 to 6 minutes grilling time per inch of thickness2 to 3 minutes per side. If the fillets are over one inch thick give them five minutes per side over direct heat then move them to a cool part of the grill to finish cooking. When the salmon flesh flakes with a fork it's done.")Separate six of the eggs. Beat the six yolks with the one whole egg until frothy.Gradually add in the sugar lemon juice and lemon rind and beat thoroughly until all ingredients are incorporated. Gradually add the cornstarch stirring constantly to ensure all is mixed through.Beat the egg whites with the salt until stiff but not dry (Steve notes that if you have a free standing mixer you can have the egg whites beating while you mix the yolk mixture as a timesaver).Fold the egg white mixture gently but thoroughly into the egg yolk mixture. (Folding is not my forte but I managed. LOL)Pour into a greased 10-ince tube pan.Bake at 350 degrees for 55 minutes or until the cake springs back when touched.Invert pan and cool thoroughly before removing cake.Prepare glaze by mixing ingredients in a small bowl.

525171,Vanilla Bourbon Caramel Apples,Remove stems from apples and place the stick inside each. Line a baking sheet with wax paper and lightly spritz it with olive oil or non-stick spray. In a medium saucepan combine sugar cream bourbon corn syrup butter vanilla vanilla bean paste and salt. Heat over medium high heat stirring until combined and bring to a boil. Attach a candy thermometer to the side and cook without stirring until temperature reaches 245 degrees F. If the mixture starts bubbling up at first (it may because of the cream do NOT take your eyes off of it) stir a bit with a pastry brush and reduce heat until it's a bit more caramely. The entire caramel process took me about 20-25 minutes but may be a bit longer or shorter depending on your heat level and pan so watch carefully.Once it reaches 245 degrees immediately dip apples (and then dip them in sprinkles or chocolate or whatever) and place on wax paper.

969303,Hot Pastrami Sliders,Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 and grease a 13x9 baking dish. Take the pack of rolls out of the bag and cut them in half width-wise. Place the bottom half in the baking pan. (I like to separate the rolls but it's a personal preference.) In a small bowl whisk together melted butter mustard horseradish salt and sugar. Mix until combined. Brush the inside of the bottom buns with the buttery mustard mixture leaving most of the mixture for the topping. Divide pastrami evenly over each slider bun. Place about 2 rings of banana peppers on each slider on top of pastrami. Divide cheese among all the slices. You can overlap the cheese slices or cut them and place them on each slider bun. Cover with the top halves of slider buns. Generously brush each top of the slider bun with buttery mustard mixture. Bake for 10-15 minutes. (Leftover rolls can be beautifully reheated in a cooking pan covered with a lid over medium heat for 5-7 minutes. Or in the oven covered with aluminum foil.),https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/969303-556x370.jpg,banana peppers-5-oz:hawaiian rolls-12-:horseradish-0.5-tsp:mustard-4-tsp:deli ham-0.5-lb:salt-1-pinch:sugar-0.5-tsp:swiss cheese-6-oz:unsalted butter-6-tbsp:
